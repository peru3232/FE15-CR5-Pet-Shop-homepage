# FE15-CR5-Pet-Shop-homepage

this layout for a pet shop uses TypeScript to display data stored in JSON format.

This project consists of a landing page and a reviews page. HTML with bootstrap, SCSS and TS were used.
Also animate was used for navbar,footer and header for demonstration.

To view the pages simply clone this repo then open index.html in your browser.

This project was done as a solution to a end of the week project during my fullstack course at code factory.

Please view the assignment.pdf to view the expected results.

Cheers!
